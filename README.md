## Project Turn-In Procedures
- Your project turns in will be electronic.
- Your electronic turn in will be done at http://teach.engr.oregonstate.edu and will consist of:
    - A PDF report. The PDF file should include:
    - A cover page (name, email address, project name)
    - Key snippets of code, if applicable
    - Tables of data
    - Graphs of data
    - Your conclusions: How did things turn out? Why do you think they turned out that way?
    - Source files of everything (.cpp, .cu, .cl).
- Don't zip any of the files you are turning in. Just turn them all in separately.
- Turn in just the source files. Don't even think about trying to turn in your whole Visual Studio solution folder!
- Submissions are due at 23:59:59 on the listed due date.
- Your project will be graded and the score posted to your Canvas Grades. If you lost any points, there will be a Canvas comment about it. If you want to reply to the comment, please do it via email, not the Canvas Comments -- I am much more reachable on email.

## Projects
#### Note: The flip machines do not have GPU cards in them, so CUDA and OpenCL will not run there. (You can compile there, you just can't run.) If your own system has a GPU, you can try using that. You can also use rabbit or the DGX machine, but please be good about sharing them.
