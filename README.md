## Project Turn-In Procedures
- Your project turnins will be electronic.
- Your electronic turnin will be done at http://teach.engr.oregonstate.edu and will consist of:
    - A PDF report. The PDF file should include:
    - A cover page (name, email address, project name)
    - Key snippets of code, if applicable
    - Tables of data
    - Graphs of data
    - Your conclusions: How did things turn out? Why do you think they turned out that way?
    - Source files of everything (.cpp, .cu, .cl).
- Don't zip any of the files you are turning in. Just turn them all in separately.
- Turn in just the source files. Don't even think about trying to turn in your whole Visual Studio solution folder!
- Submissions are due at 23:59:59 on the listed due date.
- Your project will be graded and the score posted to your Canvas Grades. If you lost any points, there will be a Canvas comment about it. If you want to reply to the comment, please do it via email, not the Canvas Comments -- I am much more reachable on email.
