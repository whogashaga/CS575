### [cuda.pptx](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs575/Handouts/cuda.1pp.pdf)
  1. Compute Unified Device Architecture
  2. Basically it means that you can write in something that looks like C and it will run on the GPU.
  3. **CPU** is always called **Host**, **GPU** is called **Device**.
  4. Page 3: `int gid` stands for global identifier.
  5. Page 6: Scheduling is just preventing GPU to be idle.
  6. Page 13: C/C++ program calls a CUDA Kernel using Special <<...>> Syntax
  7. Page 16: Getting CUDA to run under Linux. **The path(10.1) matters**!
