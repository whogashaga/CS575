## Message Passing Interface (MPI)

### [mpi.pptx](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/cs575/Handouts/mpi.1pp.pdf)

1. Basic Idea: Programs on different CPUs coordinate computations by passing messages between each other.
   <br> **Note**: Each MPI CPU must also have an integer ID assigned to it (called its ***rank***).

2. Page 7: **Do not** use ***`g++`*** command.<br>
   Use ***`mpic++`*** to compile, e.g. `mpic++ -o program program.cpp ...`<br>
   Then ***`mpiexec`*** to run, e.g. `mpiexec -mca btl self,tcp -np 4 program`

3. Page 8: The bash script, which is similar to DGX.

4. Page 10: `--main-user=user@oregonstate.edu`

5. Page 11: Cancel the job.

6. Page 13: A ***Communicator*** is a collection of CPUs that are capable of sending messages to each other.<be>
   total number of CPUs involved, **Size**, e.g. `MPI_Comm_size( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numCPUs );`<br>
   which one I am, **Rank**, e.g.`MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &me );`

7. Page 17: **`MPI_Bcast(address to get the value, # elements, data type, rank, MPI_COMM_WORLD)`**

8. Page 20: Sending Data from One Source CPU to Just One Destination CPU.<br>
   **`MPI_Send(address to get the data, # elements, data type, rank of the destination, tag to differentiate from any other transmission, MPI_COMM_WORLD)`**

9. Page 21: Receiving Data in a Destination CPU from a Source CPU.<br>
   **`MPI_Recv(address to store the data, # elements, data type, rank of the source, tag to differentiate differentiate what transmission we are looking for with this call, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &status)`**

10. Page 22: **MPI discourages you from sending to yourself!** <br>Because both the send and receive are capable of blocking til they happen, the result could be ***deadlock***!

11. Page 23: There is a Transmission Buffer to store data until `MPI_Recv` is called. This is how it does not have to synchronize really.

12. Page 24: A Better Example and more realistic way of MPI sending and receiving. ***Corresponding to Project 7.***

13. Page 25: Design Patterns: `Scatter`, `Gather`, and `Broadcast`.<br>
   ***Scatter and Gather Usually Go Together.***

14. Page 27: **MPI_Scatter()** is like broadcast. It's detailed descriptions.

15. Page 28: **MPI_Gather()**'s detailed descriptions.

16. Page 30: The global variables that everybody has.

17. Page 32: The realistic example for `MPI_Scatter()`

18. Page 33: The realistic example for `MPI_Gather()`

19. Page 35: **Have to do both left and right transmission.** In the image, *Processor#1* not only send the data of $T_i$ to $T_{i-1}$ in *Processor#0*, but also receive data from $T_{i-1}$ to $T_i$.

20. Page 41: small dataset sizes reduce performance because there is a certain amount of overhead. And if you don't have enough data to keep it busy, it kind of levels out at a certain level of performance. Notice that going from 16 nodes to 32 doesn't double the performance. Almost Amdahl's law, not quite. Flattening out.

22. What if the array cannot be broken into equal pieces? That's why we cannot use `Scatter` and `Gather` on Project 7.
