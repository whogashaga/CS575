## Functional Decomposition<br>100 Points<br>Due: April 28


### Result:
Turn in your code and your PDF writeup into Teach. Be sure your PDF is a file all by itself, that is, not part of any zip file. Your writeup will consist of:

1. What your own-choice quantity was and how it fits into the simulation.
2. A table showing values for temperature, precipitation, number of deer, height of the grain, and your own-choice quantity as a function of month number.
3. A graph showing temperature, precipitation, number of deer, height of the grain, and your own-choice quantity as a function of month number. Note: if you change the units to °C and centimeters, the quantities might fit better on the same set of axes.
   <br>`cm = inches * 2.54`
   <br>`°C = (5./9.)*(°F-32)`
   <br><br>This will make your heights have larger numbers and your temperatures have smaller numbers.
4. You do not need any performance graphs.
5. A commentary about the patterns in the graph and why they turned out that way.
   <br>What evidence in the curves proves that your own quantity is actually affecting the simulation correctly?
